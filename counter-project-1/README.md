# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Project Documentation: React Product Counter

Overview

This project is a simple React application that allows users to increment and decrement a product count, which is stored in the browser's local storage. The application features a product card displaying an image, title, price, and a rating system.

Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A build tool that provides a fast development environment.
Local Storage: Used to persist the count of the product across page reloads.
Key Features

Increment and Decrement Buttons: Users can increase or decrease the count of the product.
Local Storage Integration: The count is saved in local storage, allowing it to persist even after refreshing the page.
Responsive Design: The product card is styled to be visually appealing and responsive.

Local Storage Functions:

handleRemain: Retrieves the count from local storage when the component mounts.
handleIncrement: Increases the count and updates local storage.
handleDecrement: Decreases the count (if greater than 0) and updates local storage.
Effect Hook:

The useEffect hook calls handleRemain to set the initial count from local storage.

Rendering:

The component returns a JSX structure that includes a product card with an image, title, price, rating, and buttons for incrementing and decrementing the count.
